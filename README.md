# ECLT
A software tool for exact computation of probability of population sequences under coalescent model

ECLT: Exact Coalescent Likelihood calculation tool

ECLT is a program that computes the exact coalescent likelihood
for a set of aligned DNA sequences, assuming the infinite sites model.
For background, read the following papers and books:
